# Football Prediction

This project is intended to replicate game simulation such as in FIFA where users can simulate the football games and see real-time event such as Cards given, goals as well as results.

We are using:

- pySpark==3.5.0: Handle data processing
- tensorFlow: Build model for prediction
- Kafka: Stream real-time data such as event-notification
- Jupyter Notebook: IDE

## How it install:

1. Get Spark from [Apache Page](https://spark.apache.org/downloads.html) and follow up [Pyspark page](https://pypi.org/project/pyspark/).
2. Make sure install same version for Pypi and spark from apache.
