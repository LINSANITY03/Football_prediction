# Football Prediction

This project is intended to replicate game simulation such as in FIFA where users can simulate the football games and see real-time event such as Cards given, goals as well as results.

We are using:

- pySpark: Handle data processing
- tensorFlow: Build model for prediction
- Kafka: Stream real-time data such as event-notification
- Jupyter Notebook: IDE
