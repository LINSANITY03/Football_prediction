# Football Prediction

Following the [Google Cloud course](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/656/labs/477657), this project uses opensource tools instead of bigquery to analyze the football data, calculate shot distance and angle, then perform predictive analysis for goal outcome.

We are using:

- pySpark==3.5.0: Handle data processing
- tensorFlow: Build model for prediction
- Jupyter Notebook: IDE

## How to install:

1. Get Spark from [Apache Page](https://spark.apache.org/downloads.html) and follow up [Pyspark page](https://pypi.org/project/pyspark/).
2. Make sure install same version for Pypi and spark from apache.
3. Setup a virtual env and activate it.
